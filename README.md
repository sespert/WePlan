## Final Project - Full Stack Development Program University of Miami Cohort 2019

## Team Members

- Fabian Diaz

- Shirley Espert Galarce

- Diana Pachon

### Project Description

This React application was designed for the event organizers and for the public. It allows organizers to create events and add conferences to that event, so the public can choose which conference wants to attend. 
The attendee, on the other hand, can see all the events hosted in our site, and choose which conferences he/she wants to attend. By looking at the schedule theuy can easily see what is planned for each day.


### Key Elements and Features

- By answering a few questions, the events and conferences are stored in our database for easy retrieval from each user.
- Registration and login features to access events created and schedule.
- Easy manage of the schedule, by adding or deleting conferences of interest.
